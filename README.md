# Hecatron
With Hecatron, we have developed a framework for training a deep reinforcement learning model to associate electroencephalography (EEG) signals with any number of disjoint actions. The original intention of this project was to to control a prosthetic hand purely by using an EEG brain-computer interface, but our work can be generalized to associate any EEG signal with a desired action.
